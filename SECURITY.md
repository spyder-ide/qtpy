# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We normally support only the most recently released version with bug fixes, security updates and compatibility
improvements.

The following summarizes the support status of recent QtPy versions.

| Version | Supported          |
|---------|--------------------|
| 2.0.x   | :heavy_check_mark: |
| <2      | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you've discovered a security vulnerability in QtPy, please use open a new security advisory
with [our GitHub repo's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/spyder-ide/qtpy/security/advisories/new).
Please be sure to carefully document the vulnerability, including a summary, describing the impacts, identifying the
line(s) of code affected, stating the conditions under which it is exploitable and including a minimal reproducible test
case.

Further information and advice or patches on how to mitigate it is always welcome.
You can usually expect to hear back within 1 week, at which point we'll inform you of our evaluation of the
vulnerability and what steps we plan to take, and will reach out if we need further clarification from you.
We'll discuss and update the advisory thread, and are happy to update you on its status should you further inquire.
While this is a volunteer project and we don't have financial compensation to offer, we can certainly publicly thank and
credit you for your help if you would like.
Thanks!
