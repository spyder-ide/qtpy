"""
**QtPy** is a shim over the various Python Qt bindings. It is used to
write Qt binding independent libraries or applications.

You can set the use of one specific binding by setting up the ``QT_API``
environment variable. The default value for ``QT_API = 'pyqt5'``
(not case sensitive). For each selected binding, there will be more three
attempts if it is not found, following the most recent (Qt5) and most
stable (PyQt) API. See below:

* pyqt5: PyQt5, PySide2, PyQt4, PySide;
* pyside2: PySide2, PyQt5, PyQt4, PySide;
* pyqt4: PyQt4, PySide, PyQt5, PySide2;
* pyside: PySide, PyQt4, PyQt5, PySide2.

If one of the APIs has already been imported, then that one will be used.
(if the environment variable FORCE_QT_API is not set or set to false).
If you want to ensure that the set binding will be used, indepedent if
any other binding was imported before, you can set ``FORCE_QT_API = True``

There are some globlas variables that can be used to reach information
after QtPy is imported that shows the current setup.

- Binding set (bool): PYQT5, PYQT4, PYSIDE, PYSIDE2;
- Specific binding version (str): PYQT_VERSION, PYSIDE_VERSION;
- General binding name (str, import name): BINDING_NAME;
- General binding version (str): BINDING_VERSION;
- General generator name (str): GENERATOR_NAME;
- General generator version (str): GENERATOR_VERSION;
- General Qt version (str): QT_VERSION;
- Composed API name (str): API_NAME = BINDING_NAME (BINDING_VERSION),
                                      GENERATOR_NAME (GENERATOR_VERSION),
                                      QT_VERSION

The priority when setting the Qt binding API is detailed below:

1 QT_API is set but incorrectly, stop, error;

2 No bindings are found installed, stop, error;

3 Have NOT been already imported any Qt binding, independs on FORCE_QT_API:
    3.1 QT_API is set correctly;
        3.1.1 If binding is found, pass, no output;
        3.1.2 If binding is NOT found, try another one (three more);
            3.1.2.a If any is found (different from set), pass but warns;
    3.3 QT_API is not set, use default, continue to 3.1.1, without warning;

4 Have been already imported ONE Qt binding (not recommended):
    4.1 QT_API is set correctly;
        4.1.1 If the binding is is identical to QT_API, pass, no output,
              independs on FORCE_QT_API;
        4.1.2 If the binding is different from QT_API;
            4.1.2.a FORCE_QT_API is not set, use that imported binding,
                    pass, but warns;
            4.1.2.b FORCE_QT_API is set, stop, error;
    4.2 QT_API is not set, use default, continue to 4.1.1, without warning;

5 Have been already imported MORE than one Qt binding (highly unrecommended):
    5.1 QT_API is set correctly;
        5.1.1 If the binding is found in the imported bindings, pass,
              no output, independs on FORCE_QT_API;
        5.1.2 If the binding is NOT found in the imported bindings;
            5.1.2.a FORCE_QT_API is not set, try another one (three more);
                    5.1.2.a.i If any is found (different from set), pass
                              but warns;
            5.1.2.b FORCE_QT_API is set, stop, error;
    5.2 QT_API is not set, use default, continue to 5.1.1, without warning.

Note:
    Always preffer set the things (QT_API and FORCE_QT_API) explicit at
    the beggining of your code. Also, do all your imports using QtPy,
    avoiding using imports from PySide or PyQt directly.

Important:
    We always preffer to not break the code when something is not
    found, so we use ``warnings`` module to alert changes and show
    information that may be useful when developing with QtPy. Remember
    to set warnings to show messages.

Caution:
    Importing more than one binding in the code could cause issues and
    errors that are unpredictable, for example, when comparing instance
    types, inserting widgets from one biding to another. So, it is not
    recommended you do that.

Warning:
    If any Qt binding is imported (a different one) after QtPy import,
    issues and errors may occur and QtPy won't be able to help you
    with any warning, see Caution note.


PyQt5
=====

For PyQt5, you don't have to set anything as it will be used automatically::

    >>> from qtpy import QtGui, QtWidgets, QtCore
    >>> print(QtWidgets.QWidget)

PySide2
=======

Set the QT_API environment variable to 'PySide2' before importing other
packages::

    >>> import os
    >>> os.environ['QT_API'] = 'pyside2'
    >>> from qtpy import QtGui, QtWidgets, QtCore
    >>> print(QtWidgets.QWidget)

PyQt4
=====

Set the ``QT_API`` environment variable to 'PyQt4' before importing any python
package::

    >>> import os
    >>> os.environ['QT_API'] = 'pyqt4'
    >>> from qtpy import QtGui, QtWidgets, QtCore
    >>> print(QtWidgets.QWidget)

PySide
======

Set the QT_API environment variable to 'PySide' before importing other
packages::

    >>> import os
    >>> os.environ['QT_API'] = 'pyside'
    >>> from qtpy import QtGui, QtWidgets, QtCore
    >>> print(QtWidgets.QWidget)
